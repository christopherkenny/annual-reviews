# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Thanks for using Quarto to write your article. 
This Quarto template is unofficial and based on Annual Reviews' LaTeX template.
This is called the "Style 1" template, which may not be the only template.
Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @knuth1984texbook. As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

# Cross Referencing

To reference a figure with example label "plot", use `@fig-plot`. 
Analogously, to reference a table with example label "data", use `@tbl-data`.
To reference a section, such as the Introduction (@sec-intro), use `@sec-intro`.

For complete information on cross referencing with Quarto, see <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html>.

# First Figure and Acknowledgements

The LaTeX template that this is Quarto template is built on breaks if there is a figure on the first page.
To avoid this issue, ensure that you have filled out all of the author information.
This includes an acknowledgements entry in the header, which indicates author biographical information, along with any additional acknowledgements.

Acknowledgements should indicate the author's name, position, and affiliation, in the form of "Name is a Position at Affiliation." If the author has an [ORCID account](https://orcid.org/), their orcid should be placed in a call to `\authororcid{0000-0002-8514-4315}`, like so.
It then contains an extremely abbreviated biography, typically two sentences or so long.
Finally, the acknowledgement contains any standard acknowledgements. 


# Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. For a citation in parentheses use [@greenwade93] and for a text citation: @greenwade93. Multiple citations can be given as [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook]. Drop the author like so [-@greenwade93].


# Tables and Figures

To include figures, you can use Quarto syntax.

![Example figure](SampleFigure.pdf){#fig-plot}

For both figures and tables, you can use LaTeX syntax if you need additional customizability. 
Like, for a fancy table like this, LaTeX is likely easiest.

\begin{table}[h]
\tabcolsep7.5pt
\caption{Table caption}
\label{tbl-fancy}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l|c|c|c|c@{}}
\hline
Head 1 &&&&Head 5\\
{(}units)$^{\rm a}$ &Head 2 &Head 3 &Head 4 &{(}units)\\
\hline
Column 1 &Column 2 &Column3$^{\rm b}$ &Column4 &Column\\
Column 1 &Column 2 &Column3 &Column4 &Column\\
Column 1 &Column 2 &Column3 &Column4 &Column\\
Column 1 &Column 2 &Column3 &Column4 &Column\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{tabnote}
$^{\rm a}$Table footnote; $^{\rm b}$second table footnote.
\end{tabnote}
\end{table}

# Fancy Annual Reviews Components

## Sidebars and Margin Notes

To include margin notes, use the margin notes.
You may be interested in using this with the [latex-environment Quarto extension](https://github.com/quarto-ext/latex-environment).

\begin{marginnote}[]
\entry{Term A}{definition}
\entry{Term B}{definition}
\entry{Term C}{defintion}
\end{marginnote}

Sidebars use `textbox` environments.

\begin{textbox}[h]\section{SIDEBARS}
Sidebar text goes here.
\subsection{Sidebar Second-Level Heading}
More text goes here.\subsubsection{Sidebar third-level heading}
Text goes here.\end{textbox}

Summary Points use the `summary` environment.
\begin{summary}[SUMMARY POINTS]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Summary point 1. These should be full sentences.
\item Summary point 2. These should be full sentences.
\item Summary point 3. These should be full sentences.
\item Summary point 4. These should be full sentences.
\end{enumerate}
\end{summary}

Future Issues use the `issues` environment.
\begin{issues}[FUTURE ISSUES]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Future issue 1. These should be full sentences.
\item Future issue 2. These should be full sentences.
\item Future issue 3. These should be full sentences.
\item Future issue 4. These should be full sentences.
\end{enumerate}
\end{issues}
